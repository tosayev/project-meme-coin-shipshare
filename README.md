# ShipShareCoin Meme Coin

This project demonstrates a meme coin called "ShipShareCoin".  The idea is that a 40 million USD crude oil tanker's purchase is funded by an initial coin offering with ShipShareCoins proportional to purchase price at a 1 USD = 1 ShipShareCoin exchange rate.

In reality, this concept would not work unless a different token is used for each ship because different ships' values change differently over time.  So, if the token is supposed to represent shares in a specific vessel, each vessel should have its own custom token (for example SS987654321 for a vessel with IMO number 987654321) or a common token can be used to represent a share of a fleet of vessels.

The token can be viewed on [Etherscan](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/0xDd793F17DE38383c4eEF74DA4288e2Fdc2AA843D).
